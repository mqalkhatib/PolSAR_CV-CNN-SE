# Dataset
To validate this statement, the performance of the proposed network is evaluated on the Felovland PolSAR image. The scene was acquired by the NASA/JPL AirSAR system over the agricultural area in Netherlands with a size of 750x1024. The number of labeled samples is 207,832.

# Requirements
python 3.9, Tensorflow 2.10.0, Spyder IDE, CVNN package

# Results
To quantitatively measure the proposed model, three evaluation metrics are employed to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, including Overall Accuracy (OA), Average Accuracy (AA) and Cohen's Kappa (k).
